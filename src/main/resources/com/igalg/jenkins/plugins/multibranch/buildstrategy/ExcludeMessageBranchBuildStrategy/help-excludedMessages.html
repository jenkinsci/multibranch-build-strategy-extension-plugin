<div>
Each exclusion uses <b>Java pattern matching</b> based on standard java.util.regex package, and must be separated
by a new line.<br/>

An empty list implies that nothing is excluded.

<pre>
.*\[ci\-skip\].*
.*\[maven\-release\-plugin\].*
</pre>

The example above illustrates that if last commit contains "[ci-skip]" or "[maven-release-plugin]" phrase somewhere
in commit message, a build will not occur.
