<div>
    Path to file containing the regions to use as exclude strategy.<br />
    An empty list implies that nothing is excluded.
    <pre>
    # excluding html and jpeg changes to trigger builds
    src/main/web/**/*.html
    src/main/web/**/*.jpeg
  </pre>
    The example above illustrates that if only html/jpeg files have been committed to the SCM, a build will not occur.
